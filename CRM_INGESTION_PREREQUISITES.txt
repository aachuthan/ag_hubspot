UNIVERSAL PLATFORM INGESTION PREREQUISITES CHECKLIST
====================================================
Applicable to: CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot), Dev Tools (GitHub, Jira), 
Ad Tech (Google Ads), Productivity (Smartsheet, Teams), etc.

This generic template helps teams verify they have the necessary licenses, 
configurations, and access rights BEFORE beginning any bulk data operation.

PHASE 1: PROCUREMENT & CAPACITY (The "Rights")
Objective: Ensure the contract supports the volume and type of data execution.

PHASE 1: PROCUREMENT & CAPACITY (The "Rights")
Objective: Ensure the contract supports the volume and type of data execution.

[ ] Core Platform License Tier
    - Does the edition (e.g., Enterprise vs. Free) support the target volume?
    - CHECK: Free Tier Availability & Limits.
        - Availability: Is a "Developer Edition" or "Free Forever" plan available for testing?
        - Limitations: Check for hard caps (e.g., "Max 1000 API calls/day", "No API Support", "Data erased after 30 days").
        - Feature Gates: Does the Free version include the specific API write permission you need? (e.g., often Read-Only).
    - CHECK: Storage/Record Limits (e.g., 500k rows in Smartsheet, 2GB in CRM).
    - CHECK: Feature Gates (e.g., "API Access" often requires a paid tier).
    - RISK: Trial Expiry. Is the environment running on a Trial License that expires mid-project?

[ ] Seat Availability & Assignment (The "Hidden Blocker")
    - [ ] Pool Check: Do you have *unassigned* seats available? 
        - Example: You own 5 "Sales Pro" licenses, but 5 users are already active. 
        - Action: You must procure +1 Net New Seat for the Integration User.
    - [ ] Role Hierarchy: Does the available seat type have permissions to write to the target object?
        - Example: A "Viewer" seat typically cannot create Records via API.

[ ] Communication & Sending Capabilities (The "Volume Check")
    - [ ] Marketing Email Quota:
        - Limit Check: Does the license allow sending X emails/month? (e.g., limit is often 10x Contact Tier).
        - Blockers: Is the account "Suspended" for sending due to previous bounce rates?
    - [ ] SMS / WhatsApp / Telephony:
        - Credits: Are prepaid credits purchased? (e.g., Twilio/CRM credits are distinct from User Licenses).
        - Number Provisioning: Is a sender number active and verified (A2P 10DLC compliance)?
    - [ ] Transactional vs. Marketing API:
        - Gateway: Do you have the specific add-on for "Transactional Email" (High deliverability, no unsubscribe link) vs standard "Marketing Email"?

[ ] Module/Add-on Specific Dependencies
    - [ ] Dependency Chain: Does Feature X require Base License Y *plus* Add-on Z?
        - Example: Writing "Quotes" often requires a "Sales" license, even if you are just an Admin.
    - [ ] Legacy Granularity: Are you on a "Legacy" plan that lacks access to new objects (e.g., Custom Objects)?

[ ] Vertical/Regional Specifics
    - [ ] Compliance Add-ons: (e.g., HIPAA compliance pack required for Health Cloud).
    - [ ] Data Residency: Does the license restrict data creation to a specific region (EU vs US)?

[ ] API & Throughput Capacity
    - [ ] Throttling Limits: What is the Requests Per Minute (RPM) usage limit?
    - [ ] Burst Limits: Does the platform allow short bursts (concurrent threads)?
    - [ ] Cost per Call: Is the API metered? (e.g., Google Maps, some Azure services).

PHASE 2: ENVIRONMENT & INFRASTRUCTURE (The "Place")
Objective: Ensure a safe, isolated destination.

[ ] Isolation Strategy
    - [ ] Non-Production Instance: Sandbox, Developer tenant, or Test Project available?
    - CRITICAL: Verify the endpoint URL is NOT pointing to Production (e.g., `test.salesforce.com` vs `login.salesforce.com`).

[ ] Network & Connectivity
    - [ ] IP Whitelisting: Does the platform block unknown IPs?
    - [ ] 2FA/MFA Enforcements: Does the API user bypass MFA, or will the script fail on login challenges?
    - [ ] VPN/Firewall: Is the goal system behind a corporate firewall?

PHASE 3: ACCESS & SECURITY (The "Keys")
Objective: Ensure the automation agent has permission to act.

[ ] Service Principal / Integration User
    - [ ] Dedicated Identity: Created a "System User" (non-human) to own the records?
    - [ ] Seat Assignment: Does this user occupy a paid "seat" or license? 
      (e.g., In GitHub/Teams, a bot might still need a Licensed Seat to perform certain actions).

[ ] Authentication Method
    - [ ] Protocol: OAuth2 (Client Credentials) vs. Personal Access Token (PAT) vs. API Key.
    - [ ] Expiry Policy: Does the token expire every hour (needs refresh logic) or is it long-lived?

[ ] Permission Scopes (Least Privilege)
    - [ ] Write/Modify Rights: Explicitly granted? (Read-only is often default).
    - [ ] Scope Granularity: verify access to specific "objects" (e.g., `repo:write`, `adwords`, `crm.contacts`).

PHASE 4: SCHEMA & CONFIGURATION (The "Container")
Objective: Ensure the target system can accept the data shape.

[ ] Object/Entity Readiness
    - [ ] Custom Fields: Defined and deployed? (e.g., "GitHub Labels", "Outlook Categories").
    - [ ] Mandatory Fields: Are there "Required" fields in the UI that will block API creation? (e.g., "LastName" is mandatory).

[ ] Data Validation Rules
    - [ ] Enumerations/Picklists: Do source values match target allowed values?
    - [ ] Uniqueness Constraints: What field prevents duplicates? (Email, SKU, Handle, ID).
    - [ ] Dependency Chains: Can you create Child Record Y without Parent Record X existing first?

PHASE 5: GOVERNANCE & COMPLIANCE

[ ] Data Retention: Will this data be archived automatically?
[ ] Audit Trail: Does the platform log "Who" created the data? (Ensure it shows the Bot User, not 'Admin').
[ ] PII/GDPR: Are we inadvertently uploading personal data to a system not rated for it?
